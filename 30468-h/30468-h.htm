<h1><span class="sp1">HOLES</span><br />
<b>INCORPORATED</b></h1>

<h2>By L. Major Reynolds</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> red-headed secretary asked,
"Names, please?"</p>

<p>"Ted Baker."</p>

<p>"Bill Stephens."</p>

<p>"To see H. Joshua Blair. We
have an appointment."</p>

<p>"It's for three-thirty. We called
up two weeks ago."</p>

<p>The secretary said, "Oh, yes. I
have you on the list." She checked
them off, studied them vaguely,
asked, "What was it you wanted to
see Mr. Blair about?"</p>

<p>Ted Baker held out the small
steel box he was carrying. "About
this."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a box."</p>

<p>"I can see that," the redhead
snapped. "What is it for? What
does it do?"</p>

<p>"It's for construction work. It
makes holes."</p>

<p>The girl sighed. It was late in the
day and she didn't care much, really.
She snapped an intercom button.
An inquiring voice rasped at
her. She said, "A Mr. Baker and a
Mr. Stephens to see you."</p>

<p>Evidently it was all right because
she snapped off the button and
pointed to a door. "In there."</p>

<p>They went in the door and faced
a desk large enough to play tennis
on. The man behind the desk gave
them a cordial snarl. "Well, what
have you got on your mind? And
don't take all day to tell me."</p>

<p>Ted extended the box. "This.
We'd like to sell it to you."</p>

<p>"What is it? A bomb?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. It makes holes. It makes
holes real quick."</p>

<p>Blair scowled at the box. "What
the hell do I want of holes?"</p>

<p>Bill Stephens came forward with
further explanation. "You see, sir,
Ted and I are inventors. We make,
well&mdash;things. We've been working
on this invention in our basement
and it seems to be a success."</p>

<p>"We don't quite know why it's a
success," Ted said, "but it is."</p>

<p>"We'd like to demonstrate it for
you."</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead and demonstrate."</p>

<p>Ted raised the box and aimed it
horizontally at nothing in particular.
He pressed a black button.
There was an odd whirring noise.
He took his hand off the button and
lowered the box.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for?"
Blair growled.</p>

<p>"Nothing. That's it. I've made
the hole."</p>

<p>"Are you two crazy? What kind
of a fool trick&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Ted reached down and took a
pencil off the desk. "May I borrow
this?" Without waiting for permission,
he put the pencil carefully into
the place he'd pointed the box. Half
the pencil disappeared. He took his
hand away. The part of the pencil
still in sight didn't come with it. It
stayed where it was, lying in thin
air, horizontally, with no apparent
support.</p>

<p>H. Joshua Blair goggled and
turned three shades whiter. "Wha-wha-what
the hell!"</p>

<p>"And now, if you'll try to move
the pencil, the demonstration will
be complete."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Like</span> a man in a trance, Blair
got up from his desk and
grasped the pencil. It wouldn't
move. He got red in the face and
threw all his weight on it. It would
neither pull nor push. It stayed
where it was. Finally Blair backed
away from the thing. He leaned on
his desk and panted.</p>

<p>"You see," Ted said, "The hole
goes into the fourth dimension.
There's no other explanation. And
the fourth dimension holds solider
than concrete."</p>

<p>Old Blair's head was spinning,
but business instinct came quickly
to his rescue. "What happens," he
asked, "if something in the third
dimension is in the way?"</p>

<p>"It gets out of the way," Bill said.</p>

<p>Ted demonstrated. He trained
the box on the visible remains of the
pencil. It vanished.</p>

<p>Blair said, "Well, I'll be damned!"</p>

<p>"We figure this will save you a lot
of money in construction work,"
Bill said. "You can get along without
riveters. You just have a man
put holes in girders with this and
push the rivets through. You also
make holes for the beam-ends, and
your entire building will be anchored
in the fourth dimension."</p>

<p>"Do it again," Blair said.</p>

<p>Ted made another hole and put
another pencil into it. Blair grasped
the pencil and applied leverage.
The pencil snapped at the point it
entered the next dimension but the
broken end of the far piece was not
to be seen.</p>

<p>Blair asked, "You say you two
invented this gadget?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Bill said. "We've
got a workshop in my basement. We
invent in the evenings after we
come home from work."</p>

<p>"What do you work at?"</p>

<p>"I read gas meters. He's a clerk
in a supermarket."</p>

<p>"I suppose you want money for
this thing."</p>

<p>"We'd like to sell it, yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How much do you want for it?"</p>

<p>"Well, we don't know. What's it
worth to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing probably. Leave it here
a few days. I'll look it over and let
you know."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And don't call me&mdash;I'll call
you."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave your address and phone
number with my secretary."</p>

<p>After Ted and Bill left, Blair
yelled, "Get me Jake Steadman in
the engineering department!" He
didn't bother using the intercom,
but his secretary heard him anyhow.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ted and Bill went to work on an
idea they had for the treatment of
leather. You dipped your shoes in a
solution and they lasted forever.
The thing didn't work too well,
however. It was full of bugs. They
tried to eliminate the bugs and once
in a while they thought of H.
Joshua Blair.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's about time
he called us?" Ted asked.</p>

<p>"Don't be so impatient. He's a
big man. He owns a big company.
It takes time."</p>

<p>"He's had over a month."</p>

<p>"Relax. We'll hear from him."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Another</span> week passed, and
another, until one evening
Ted came galloping into the workshop
with news. "That big new addition
to the City Hall! They're
working on it! H. Joshua Blair Construction
Company. A big sign says
so!"</p>

<p>"Relax. You'll blow a tube."</p>

<p>"Relax hell! He's using our invention
to put up the steel girders.
Just like we suggested to him. Guys
with boxes like ours making holes
and putting in rivets!"</p>

<p>Bill stopped what he was doing.
"He said he'd call us. Maybe he forgot.
Maybe we better go see him."</p>

<p>They both knocked off work the
next day and got to Blair's office at
nine o'clock. The red-headed
secretary said, "You'll have to make
an appointment."</p>

<p>"Appointment hell!" Ted headed
for the inner door. Bill followed
him. They went into H. Joshua
Blair's office to find him in conference
with two vice-presidents.
Ted said, "Mr. Blair, we came&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who in the devil are you?"</p>

<p>"You remember us. Ted Baker
and Bill Stephens. We came about
our invention."</p>

<p>"What invention?"</p>

<p>"Our hole maker. You're using it
on the City Hall addition."</p>

<p>Blair glowered. "Where'd you get
the idea it was yours? Have you got
any patents to show?"</p>

<p>"Well, no. We didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did! Fourteen good solid
patents. You two better go peddle
your groceries."</p>

<p>"Now look, Mr. Blair."</p>

<p>Blair raised his voice. "Throw
these two bums out!"</p>

<p>Three huskies appeared as by
magic to do Blair's bidding. As Ted
and Bill landed on the sidewalk, one
of the vice-presidents said, "Do you
think that was smart, H. J.? They
might cause trouble."</p>

<p>Blair snorted. "They haven't got
a prayer. A meter reader and a
grocery clerk!"</p>

<p>"We could have at least given
them a few hundred."</p>

<p>"Not on your life. Never give a
sucker an even break, Jim. Give
them anything at all, we acknowledge
their claim. That'd be stupid."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm right. It's business.
Now about those other bids. By
gad! We can run every contractor in
town out of competition! They
can't touch our prices!"</p>

<p>Out on the sidewalk, Bill and Ted
sat mournfully looking up at the
vast steel skeleton, held together
literally by their own genius. Ted
said, "We got a raw deal."</p>

<p>"Maybe we had it coming. We
were pretty stupid."</p>

<p>"Anything we can do?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't look like it."</p>

<p>"Maybe the leather solution will
turn out."</p>

<p>"Maybe." Bill looked wistfully up
at the steel skeleton. "At even a cent
a hole, we'd have done all right."</p>

<p>"Let's go home and get to work."</p>

<hr />

<p>In the Mighty and Benevolent
Kingdom of Szkazia, a minor reign
of terror existed. The King, tired of
complaints from his subjects, had
just finished dressing down his
Prime Minister. The Prime Minister
was passing the abuse on to his
Chief Scientist. "If something isn't
done soon, I won't be responsible
for your head, my friend. The King
is in a rage."</p>

<p>The eyes of the Chief Scientist
watered&mdash;partly from fear, and
partly from nights and days spent
in his laboratory beating out his
brains on one idea after another.</p>

<p>"I'm doing my best, sire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not good enough! These
steel girders coming out of nowhere!
Banging people in the head&mdash;whacking
them in the stomach!
Why it isn't safe to walk through the
halls of the Administration Building.
Even the bedrooms of the Executive
Apartments are not safe! The
other night the Director of Propaganda
had just gone to bed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know of the incident," the
Chief Scientist said hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you do? But you've done
nothing about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've been working hard," the
scientist said patiently, "and I think
I have the solution. Give me another
day."</p>

<p>"One day, then. After that&mdash;"
The Prime Minister made a significant
slicing motion with his finger.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Prime Minister chewed his
fingernails and watched the
clock. Sleep was out of the question
with the King calling up every little
while yelling for action. The
Minister counted the hours and
presented himself at the Royal
Laboratories precisely twenty-four
hours later. "Time's up," he
snapped.</p>

<p>The Chief Scientist was wiping
his face. There were new lines
around his mouth. He indicated a
small steel box. "I think I've got it,"
he said. "Come with me."</p>

<p>They went swiftly to the Administration
Building. "This should be
close enough. We depress this lever
and&mdash;and hope."</p>

<p>"Well, do it&mdash;do it!"</p>

<p>The Chief Scientist pushed the
lever on the steel box. A whirring
sound came from within. All the
steel girder ends in sight&mdash;all the
nasty little rivets&mdash;disappeared.
The Chief Scientist smiled and
wiped his face again. "It worked,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Excellent. I'll see that you get a
medal."</p>

<p>"Thank you," the Chief Scientist
said sadly. That was the trouble
with people nowadays. They either
handed you a medal or your head.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Ted</span> and Bill stared sadly at
the mess around the City Hall.
Bill said, "It's a good thing it collapsed
at night so nobody was
killed, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You said it. I'd have felt guilty
if there'd been any casualties."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose went
wrong?"</p>

<p>"You got me. What do you think
they'll do to old Blair?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but it looks pretty
bad. They refused to let him out on
bail."</p>

<p>"Serves him right. The way he
treated us."</p>

<p>"You've got it wrong. He treated
us swell. He did us a big favor. We
could have been blamed for this."</p>

<p>Bill thought it over before saying,
"I guess you're right. I hadn't
looked at it that way."</p>

<p>"Let's go home and get to work
on the leather solution."</p>

<p>So they did.</p>

<p class="hd1">THE END</p>
